- Understanding the unit's of code you want to build
    - Tests may make you collaborate with a broad range of people involved with your code
    - Even if writing tests for yourself, unit testing will help you think things through in detail




- They also document the units of code
    - specify the behaviour of the unit under test
    - how the originial developer inteded the unit to be used

- Help design the units
    - code must then have units
        - loosely coupled
        - high cohesion
    - unit tests are like a headline, and units are like the article
    - being forced to write headlines (unit tests) first, should improve the design of your article (units)
    - allows for refactoring

- Help avoid regression issues in future
    - regression is when something used to work, but no longer does
    - if you change something, the tests should quickly alert you to what part of the code went wrong
